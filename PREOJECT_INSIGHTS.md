- use PerspectiveCard.vue for mapping out links to previous projects

---------- TO DO ----------

- Hero Header
  - Create CSS Media Query rules for re-sizing background on smaller screens ('background-size: cover' is too small)
- Light Refactoring to ConstellationBackground converting it to Setup and Typecript

* Previous Projects Page
* About-Me/Contact Page
* Home Page
* 404 Page
  ---------- TO DO ----------

  ---------- IDEAS ----------

* At the end of the page, we can have a campfire, with some nice ash and wisps effects with ParticlesJS
  - for interactivity we could do marshmallows - user can pick one up on a stick and the tip of the stick follows the position of the cursor
* Something like a Director's Commentary mode -> we have toggle somewhere that activates this
  - while this mode is on we make appear tooltips on any elements or parts of the Project that we think are particularly interesting
  - on these tooltips talk about how the parts were made, what was our process and stuff like that
  - highlight particular obstacles that we overcame in unusual, interesting ways
* On ContactInfo - do a business card style effect
  - we can use the 3D properties of PerspectiveCard
  - first we pick and reproduce a business card aesthetic
  - also have the text content use GhostlyTypewriter with 'scroll into view' effect
* I'm really interested in doing something with 3D rendering on a website
  - Don't really know what yet
  - checkout for inspiraiton -> https://jesse-zhou.com/ , https://bruno-simon.com/ and https://dvlpr.pro/#home
* Code lens / minimap or something

- on some corder of the screen we add the code that composes that section of the page
- like a minimap, and we can have the code display change as the user moves their mouse across the items on the screen and scrolls

  ---------- STALE IDEAS ----------

* Use some Persona 5 style UI elements
* Typewriter effect on Landing Page - page's text is written(with typing effect) as user scrolls down
* GhostlyTypewritter alternative
  - have a container and inside it all the letters that compose the sentence are constantly moving around randomly
  - when container scrolls into viewport the letters organize into the sentence (one by one left to right, like typewritter)
  - when container scrolls out of viewport the letters return to randomly moving around
  - Or maybe on mouse hover instead of scroll into viewport?
