- use PerspectiveCard.vue for mapping out links to previous projects

---------- TO DO ----------

- Hero Header

  - Create CSS Media Query rules for re-sizing background on smaller screens ('background-size: cover' is too small)

- Light Refactoring to ConstellationBackground converting it to Setup and Typecript

* Previous Projects Page
* About-Me/Contact Page
* Home Page
* 404 Page
  ---------- TO DO ----------

  ---------- IDEAS ----------

* GhostlyTypewritter alternative

  - have a container and inside it all the letters that compose the sentence are constantly moving around randomly
  - when container scrolls into viewport the letters organize into the sentence (one by one left to right, like typewritter)
  - when container scrolls out of viewport the letters return to randomly moving around
  - Or maybe on mouse hover instead of scroll into viewport?

* At the end of the page, we can have a campfire, with some nice ash and wisps effects with ParticlesJS

- for interactivity we could do marshmallows - user can pick one up on a stick and the tip of the stick follows the position of the cursor

* Use some Persona 5 style UI elements

* Typewriter effect on Landing Page - page's text is written(with typing effect) as user scrolls down
