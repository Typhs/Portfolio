- use PerspectiveCard.vue for mapping out links to previous projects

- Check if it's raining in user's location, and if so change some of the aesthetics:
  - fetch user location: this can be done either by fetching the user IP and geolocating it, or prompting the user's broswer to 'allow location sharing'
  - with user location fetch weather data to see if it's raining on such location
  - if so, do some func mechanics with it, like adding light raining effect on the background, or maybe something with an umbrella

  ---------- TO DO ----------

  ---------- IDEAS ----------

* On hero Header - use some parralaxing effect - not many layers are need, I actually think more than like 4 would be too much, 2 or 3 would be nice

  - we can have like a 2° layer that's initially fully hidden by the 1° one but scrolls faster than the previous ones, so it'll show in the background upon scroll

* At the end of the page, we can have a campfire, with some nice ash and wisps effects with ParticlesJS

- for interactivity we could do marshmallows - user can pick one up on a stick and the tip of the stick follows the position of the cursor
