ROUGH IDEAS: 
- We can have some character of easter egg appear in random spots of the website, slightly hidden - when clicked it may teleport elsewhere random

- Code Lenses - Some way for the user to find the source code of a certain element - may be an overlay, or perphas a draggable lens-like element or something else entirely

- Maybe use the very code that composes the websiteu in the background (maybe we can do something the Matrix effect)

PAGES:
- Old Projects
	
- "About me" page - where we list where we are and how we got here, also contact info

- Home page

	* Starts with Parallaxing scene and a typewriter title - just like our old portfolio
